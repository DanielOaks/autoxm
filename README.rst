AutoXM
======
AutoXM creates music files, in `.xm` format!

This is based off the `autotracker.py` project from Ben "GreaseMonkey" Russell, starting off as a port of that from `.it` to `.xm`, with plans to expand the song generation.

**NOTE:** *This does not actually work yet. I'm still in the initial stages of sample and instrument generation, with melody generation to come soon.*
